# Epic Spies Assignment

This is a small pet project that I did while doing the course C# fundamentals by ASP.NET on DevU.com.

The idea is to work with DateTime and TimeSpan types as well as celender control of ASP.NET.

The business rules are as follows:

requirement: Our logo should only be 190 px tall!

Business Rule 1: Initialize the calendar controls. Make sure the end of the previous assignment date is set to today.  Make sure the start date of the new assignment is set for an additional 14 days from today.  Make sure the end date of the new assignment is set for an additional 21 days from today.

Business Rule 2: The United Spy Workers Union dictates there must be at least two weeks of paid time between assignments.  If at least two weeks are not selected between the previous assignment and the new assignment display an error message.  Also, show the manager the earliest available date on the calendar by selecting and showing that date in the "Start of New Date" Calendar.

Business Rule 3: Spies cost $500 per day against your Assignment's budget.  Display the budget to the manager in text at the bottom of the web page.

Business Rule 4: If the assignment is greater than three weeks, an additional $1,000 budget fee will be assessed.
